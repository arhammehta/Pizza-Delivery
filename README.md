Built a model for a optimization problem of orders to determine the number of chefs required in a restaurant. Using optimal balancing of loads amongst the cooks allows to quantify the output in a better way than serial orders will impact the outcomes. Trained a XGBRegressor model to predict the the number of orders and then made a decision based on the output.
